```

## Before starting the analysis

Load the data and store it in an object 'samples'. The data I am using was downloaded from the UCSC Xena project. It combines RNASeq data from TCGA (cancer tissues) and GTex (normal tissues) via a common bioinformatics pipeline - so you can directly compare values from both studies.

```{r}
samples <- 
  read.delim("~/Desktop/crc_prognosis/tcga_target_gtex_colorectal.tsv", 
             header=TRUE)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
