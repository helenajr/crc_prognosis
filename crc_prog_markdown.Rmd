The T gene encodes the transcription factor Brachyury. It is an essential transcription factor for normal development, playing an important role in gastrulation and notochord formation, however it is switched off in most adult tissues. It can be re-expressed in cancer and the purpose of this project is to see if re-expression is associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer, using tcga data.

Firstly we need to load the data

```{r}
Texpression <- read.delim("~/Desktop/crc_prognosis/2020-21-07_coadread.tsv")
```
