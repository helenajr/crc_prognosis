The T gene encodes the transcription factor Brachyury. It is an
essential transcription factor for normal development, playing an
important role in gastrulation and notochord formation, however it is
switched off in most adult tissues. It can be re-expressed in cancer and
the purpose of this project is to see if re-expression is associated
with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer, using tcga data.

Firstly we need to load the data

``` r
Texpression <- read.delim("~/Desktop/crc_prognosis/2020-21-07_coadread.tsv")
```
